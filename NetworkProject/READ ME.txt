Welcome to my networks and secrity IoT project. The inspiration for this came from the idea that 
smart medical devices would need a secure channel to transfer data from a pateints house
to the medical office server. This is a real life scenario and my project (when adjusted to
this scenario) would suffice this criteria. For example purposes I have changed this to a secure
messaging service between a client and server.

The zip includes the main server as well as multiple clients. You can choose to either run 
multiple instances of a client through cmd or just run each client file, its up to you. The json file 
is to be left untouched as this stores data between sessions. To start it up launch the server.py file
after this launch any client you want to connect and follow the instructions on the terminal.

Thank You
